# SpaceInvaders

The logic was inspired from https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Space-Invaders-Pygame, and the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w. 

This just happens to be my take on the classic game with the starting code coming from the video/repo (refactored to my liking).

## Installation & Usage

Since the game is written in Python, it can be considered cross platform.
