# SpaceInvaders

The logic was inspired from https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Space-Invaders-Pygame, and the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w. 

This just happens to be my take on the classic game with the starting code coming from the video/repo (refactored to my liking).

## Installation

Since the game is written in Python, it can be considered cross platform.

***Pre-requisites***
   * Python >3.6
   * pygame

## Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/reap2sow1/SpaceInvaders.git
cd SpaceInvaders
python main.py
```
